A simple web app that shortens URLS, and keeps data anylitics for each URl made(who clicked, and time of click, totall clicks, unique clicks.) has mock databases within the server file to store this information. all passwords are hashed. all cookies encrypted, uses proper http protocols-- DELETE PUT. 

I used the following dependencies:
express
ejs
body-parser
cookie-session
method-override
bcrypt
moment
moment-time-zone
